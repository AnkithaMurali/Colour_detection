# Colour_detection
This project performs real-time color detection using a webcam feed. It focuses on a central region of the video frame and classifies the dominant color (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Orange, Purple, White, Gray, or Black) based on HSV values. Ideal for quick color recognition tasks, educational demos, or integrating basic computer vision into larger systems.

Built with Python + OpenCV.
Features include on-the-spot classification, real-time ROI tracking, and accurate detection even in varying lighting conditions.
